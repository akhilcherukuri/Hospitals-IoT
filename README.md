## Abstract 
The Internet of Things(IoT) has set a milestone in the digital era, increasing in almost every sector, from commercial to educational. The concept is taking over due to its simplicity yet accuracy. In such systems, hardware, software, and services are perfectly blended to extract intelligence from data sets. These intelligent objects need minimal human intervention, and hence this technology is now slowly pacing towards taking over the health sector. 

Although there has been some significant advancement in healthcare IoT technologies, such existing technologies seem to be inadequate recently due to the sudden outburst of COVID-19. There is a lack of a unified system that can incorporate various sensors and efficiently send and process large amounts of data. Furthermore, the current IoT healthcare system does not provide an intuitive user interface and a secure communication mode.  

This project aims to provide a more efficient healthcare model that monitors a patient's health remotely by using various sensors and collecting them in an online database creating a virtual infrastructure. The accumulated data is going to be accessible to both healthcare providers as well as patients in real-time. The system will also generate alarming signals in case of abnormalities in the patient's condition from the data collected to achieve preventive care. For assistance and emergency, patients will be able to interact with the system having Alexa skills.
